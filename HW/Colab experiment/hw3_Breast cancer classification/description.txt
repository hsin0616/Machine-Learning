In this assignment, I used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to perform binary classification (benign vs. malignant) and built three baseline models: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree.
The workflow emphasized proper methodology, including feature scaling with StandardScaler (for Logistic Regression and SVM), GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using classification error rate.
I reported the mean and standard deviation of error rates across 5 folds, then summarized the methodology, results, and key conclusions in the notebook.
